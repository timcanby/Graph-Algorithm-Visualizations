## üìñ Overview

Graph Algorithm Visualizations is a comprehensive educational toolkit designed to make complex graph algorithms accessible and intuitive through interactive web-based visualizations. Each algorithm is presented not merely as a sequence of computational steps, but as a compelling story that reveals the underlying logic and mathematical beauty of these fundamental computer science concepts.

Built entirely with modern web technologies including D3.js, HTML5, CSS3, and ES6+ JavaScript, this project delivers self-contained visualizations that require no installation, no server setup, and no external dependencies. Simply open any HTML file in your browser and begin exploring the fascinating world of graph algorithms.

### üéØ Educational Philosophy

This project is founded on the principle that **visualization enhances understanding**. Rather than presenting algorithms as abstract mathematical formulations, each visualization tells a story:

- **Dijkstra's Algorithm** becomes a "ripple of discovery" spreading across the graph
- **Prim's Algorithm** transforms into organic "growth from a seed" 
- **Kosaraju's Algorithm** reveals the hidden structure through "tangled web ‚Üí reversal ‚Üí discovery"
- **A* Pathfinding** demonstrates intelligent exploration guided by heuristic intuition

### üåü Why This Project Matters

## üìö Algorithms

This collection features seven carefully selected graph algorithms, each representing a different category of graph problems and solution approaches. Every algorithm includes detailed explanations, interactive controls, and visual storytelling elements.

### üîç Shortest Path Algorithms

#### Dijkstra's Algorithm: Single-Source Shortest Paths
**File**: `Dijkstra.html`  
**Complexity**: O((V + E) log V)  
**Use Cases**: GPS navigation, network routing, social network analysis

Dijkstra's algorithm finds the shortest paths from a single source vertex to all other vertices in a weighted graph with non-negative edge weights. The visualization presents this as a "ripple of discovery" where shortest paths expand outward like waves from the source.

**Key Visualization Features**:
- **Live Priority Queue**: Watch as vertices are selected based on their current shortest distance
- **Color-Coded Progress**: Vertices transition through states (unvisited ‚Üí visiting ‚Üí visited)
- **Edge Relaxation**: See how distances are updated when shorter paths are discovered
- **Interactive Source Selection**: Click any vertex to set it as the new source

**Educational Story**: Imagine you're standing at the center of a pond and drop a stone. The ripples spread outward at a constant speed, reaching closer points first and distant points later. Dijkstra's algorithm works similarly ‚Äì it discovers shortest paths in order of their actual distance from the source.

#### Floyd-Warshall Algorithm: All-Pairs Shortest Paths
**File**: `Floyd-Warshall.html`  
**Complexity**: O(V¬≥)  
**Use Cases**: Dense graphs, transitive closure, detecting negative cycles

The Floyd-Warshall algorithm computes shortest paths between every pair of vertices using dynamic programming. This visualization uniquely combines graph and matrix representations, showing how the algorithm systematically considers each vertex as an intermediate point.

**Key Visualization Features**:
- **Synchronized Graph-Matrix View**: See how matrix updates correspond to graph changes
- **Pivot Vertex Highlighting**: Watch as each vertex serves as an intermediate point
- **Interactive Path Queries**: Click any two vertices to see their shortest path
- **Triangular Relaxation**: Visualize the core operation: if dist[i][k] + dist[k][j] < dist[i][j]

**Educational Story**: Think of this algorithm as asking "What if I could go through this intermediate city?" for every possible intermediate city. It systematically explores whether routing through each vertex provides a shorter path between any pair of destinations.

#### Bellman-Ford Algorithm: Handling Negative Weights
**File**: `Bellman-Ford.html`  
**Complexity**: O(VE)  
**Use Cases**: Currency arbitrage, network protocols, graphs with negative weights

Unlike Dijkstra's algorithm, Bellman-Ford can handle negative edge weights and detect negative cycles. The visualization emphasizes the iterative refinement process and dramatically highlights negative cycle detection.

**Key Visualization Features**:
- **Iteration-Based Animation**: See V-1 rounds of edge relaxations
- **Negative Weight Handling**: Special highlighting for negative-weight edges
- **Negative Cycle Detection**: Dramatic flashing animation when cycles are found
- **Distance Convergence**: Watch how distance estimates improve over iterations

**Educational Story**: Bellman-Ford is like a patient detective who checks every possible clue (edge) multiple times to ensure no shorter path is missed. If distances keep improving after V-1 iterations, it knows something suspicious (a negative cycle) is happening.

#### A* (A-Star) Pathfinding: Heuristic-Guided Search
**File**: `A*.html`  
**Complexity**: O(b^d) where b is branching factor and d is depth  
**Use Cases**: Game AI, robotics, puzzle solving

A* combines the guaranteed optimality of Dijkstra's algorithm with the efficiency of greedy best-first search by using a heuristic function. This grid-based visualization allows interactive obstacle placement and demonstrates intelligent pathfinding.

**Key Visualization Features**:
- **Interactive Grid Environment**: Draw walls and obstacles by clicking and dragging
- **Open/Closed Set Visualization**: See which cells are being considered vs. already processed
- **Heuristic Guidance**: Watch how the algorithm intelligently explores toward the goal
- **Dynamic Start/End Points**: Drag the start (green) and end (red) points anywhere
- **Real-time Path Updates**: See the optimal path update as you modify the environment

**Educational Story**: A* is like a smart traveler who not only considers the distance already traveled but also estimates the remaining distance to the destination. This allows it to explore promising directions first while still guaranteeing the shortest path.


### üå≥ Minimum Spanning Tree Algorithms

#### Kruskal's Algorithm: Forest Merging Approach
**File**: `Kruskal.html`  
**Complexity**: O(E log E)  
**Use Cases**: Network design, clustering, circuit design

Kruskal's algorithm builds a minimum spanning tree by considering edges in order of increasing weight and adding them if they don't create a cycle. The visualization emphasizes the forest-merging nature of this approach.

**Key Visualization Features**:
- **Edge Sorting Visualization**: See edges arranged by weight in the control panel
- **Component-Based Coloring**: Different colors represent different connected components
- **Union-Find Operations**: Watch components merge as edges are accepted
- **Accept/Reject Decisions**: Clear visual feedback for each edge consideration
- **Forest Evolution**: Observe how multiple trees gradually merge into one

**Educational Story**: Imagine you're building a railway network connecting cities with the minimum total track length. Kruskal's approach is like a cost-conscious engineer who always chooses the cheapest available connection that links previously unconnected regions.

#### Prim's Algorithm: Organic Growth Approach
**File**: `Prim.html`  
**Complexity**: O((V + E) log V)  
**Use Cases**: Network design, approximation algorithms, dense graphs

Prim's algorithm grows a minimum spanning tree from a single starting vertex, always adding the cheapest edge that connects the current tree to a new vertex. The visualization presents this as organic growth from a seed.

**Key Visualization Features**:
- **Seed-Based Growth**: Watch the tree grow organically from the starting vertex
- **Frontier Edge Highlighting**: See candidate edges that could extend the tree
- **Live Priority Queue**: Observe how frontier edges are prioritized by weight
- **Growth Animation**: Smooth transitions as the tree expands vertex by vertex
- **Tree vs. Non-Tree Edges**: Clear distinction between included and excluded edges

**Educational Story**: Prim's algorithm is like growing a plant from a seed. The tree starts small and gradually extends its reach, always choosing the most efficient (lowest weight) way to connect to new territory. Unlike Kruskal's forest-merging approach, Prim maintains a single connected component throughout.

### üîó Graph Structure Analysis

#### Kosaraju's Algorithm: Strongly Connected Components
**File**: `Kosaraju.html`  
**Complexity**: O(V + E)  
**Use Cases**: Social network analysis, compiler optimization, web graph analysis

Kosaraju's algorithm finds strongly connected components (SCCs) in a directed graph using two depth-first searches. The visualization reveals the elegant "tangled web ‚Üí reversal ‚Üí discovery" process.

**Key Visualization Features**:
- **Two-Phase Process**: First DFS on original graph, second DFS on transpose
- **Finish-Time Stack**: See how vertices are ordered by their completion times
- **Graph Reversal**: Watch the graph edges reverse direction between phases
- **SCC Clustering**: Different colors highlight each strongly connected component
- **Stack-Based Discovery**: Observe how the finish-time stack guides SCC discovery

**Educational Story**: Finding strongly connected components is like untangling a complex web of relationships. Kosaraju's brilliant insight is that by traversing the graph in a specific order (determined by finish times) and then exploring the reversed graph, we can cleanly separate the tangled structure into distinct, strongly connected groups.
